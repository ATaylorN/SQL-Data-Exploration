Things I learned:

Exploration: How to create temporary tables, How to create views, What CTEs are and how to create them. I also dealt with an interesting additional challenge in that my dataset had an additional 2 years worth of data. When I went to create rolling totals, for example, 
I ran into issues with the data type not being large enough to hold the data I needed it to. Long story short, I used the cast and convert functions a lot as well as bigint.

Cleaning: How to use Parsename function, how to join a table on itself and where that
might be useful. This exercise was mostly a great refresher on what I already knew of SQL
